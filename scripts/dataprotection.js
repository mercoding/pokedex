        <p><strong>Relevant legal bases according to the GDPR: </strong>Below you will find an overview of the
            Legal basis of the GDPR on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note,
            that in addition to the regulations of the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in your or our
            country
            of residence or domicile
            can. If more specific legal bases are relevant in individual cases, we will inform you about them in the
            Data protection declaration with.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fulfillment of the contract and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b) GDPR) -
                    The
                    Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or
                    for
                    Implementation of pre-contractual measures required at the request of the data subject.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f) GDPR)</strong> - The processing is to protect
                the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party are necessary, unless these interests
                or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject that require the protection of personal data,
                predominate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany: </strong>In addition to the data protection
            regulations
            of
            the GDPR
            National data protection regulations apply in Germany. This includes in particular the law on protection
            Misuse of personal data during data processing (Federal Data Protection Act – BDSG). The BDSG contains
            in particular special regulations on the right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object
            Processing of special categories of personal data, for processing for other purposes and for transfer
            as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore, can

            General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, we ask you to note that due to the wider
            The terms of the GDPR are used for spatial application and comprehensibility. Especially instead of the one
            in
            Swiss DSG used the terms “processing” of “personal data”, “overriding interest” and “particular
            Personal data worthy of protection" means the terms "processing" used in the GDPR mean "personal
            Data" as well as "legitimate interest" and "special categories of data" are used. The legal meaning of the
            However, within the scope of the Swiss DSG, terms will continue to be determined according to the Swiss DSG.

        <h2 id="m27">Safety measures</h2>
        <p>We take measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art
            Implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing as well as the
            different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to natural rights and freedoms
            appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk
            guarantee.</p>
        <p>The measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data
            Control of physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to it
            Input, distribution, ensuring availability and their separation. We also have procedures
            set up to ensure the exercise of the rights of those affected, the deletion of data and reactions to the
            threat
            ensure the data. We also take the protection of personal data into account during development
            or selection of hardware, software and procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection
            Technology design and data protection-friendly default settings.</p>

        <h2 id="m25">Transfer of personal data</h2>

            third party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other people, entities or companies
            takes place, this only takes place in accordance with the legal requirements. If the level of data
            protection in
            the
            If a third country has been recognized by means of an adequacy decision (Art. 45 GDPR), this serves as the
            basis
            for
            the
            Data transfers. Furthermore, data transfers only take place if the level of data protection is otherwise
            secured,
            in particular through standard contractual clauses (Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c) GDPR), express consent or in the
            case
